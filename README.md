## 🖥️ Technologies Used

* React: For building a seamless UI.
* Framer Motion: For jaw-dropping animations.
* TailwindCSS: For modern, responsive styling.
* Vite: Because who has time for slow build tools?
* JavaScript: Of course, it’s JavaScript. What else?

It’s not about the tools you use; it’s about how creatively you use them. Except for TailwindCSS… that’s just a lifesaver. 🚑

## 🎨 Features

- Responsive and user-friendly design
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Dynamic and interactive UI components
